# PG Theme Parks

Northcoders wants to get all the major theme parks to sign up to a service we will be creating to help theme park lovers find the best rides and food options at all the theme parks in the UK.

Before we can do that, we need to get some sample data into our database so we can get them interested. We have provided you with some js files that contain this sample data.

Your tasks today will involve creating the tables, inserting the data and confirming that all of that data has been added.

###Â Task 1

First you will need to create your databases, to do this run the `npm run setup-db` command.

Now you have your databases you can create your database connection, to do this you'll need to update the `connection.js` file, we have already made the file but you'll need to add the code.

- Install [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/)
- Create a new [connection pool](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting) in the `db/connection.js` file
- Export the connection pool so that it is available for use in other files

###Â Task 2

Now that we can connect to your database, lets start the process of seeding it.

The order in which we are going to create our tables, in the structure of our data we need to first create the tables that do not reference other tables.

The `parks` table is one that doesn't have any relations.

Update the `createParks` function to create a table called parks in your `seed.js` file.

The table will need:

- park_id : Serial Primary Key
- park_name : VarChar Not Null
- year_opened: INT Not Null
- annual_attendance: INT not null

You can check this has worked by running `npm run seed` and checking the table looks as expected in the `psql` command line.

### Task 3

Next you'll need to create the `rides` table and add it to the seed function

The table will need a serial primary key of ride_id, and a park_id key that will be an INT and need to reference the parks tables park_id column, it will also need a ride_name, year_opened and votes column, take a look at the data to decide on what data types to make them.

### Task 4

Now that we have created our tables we will need to insert some data into it.

create a function called `insertParks` and add it to the promise chain in the seed function.

You will need to install pg-format `npm install -D pg-format` to do this.

[documentation](https://github.com/datalanche/node-pg-format)

This function should insert all of the parks data that we are requiring in on line 1.

### Task 5

Now we should have some parks data stored in our database, You can complete the `selectParks` function in models.js

In order to ensure this is working correctly we have written the tests for you.

Feel free to add a `.only` to the first test to avoid a few errors if you wish.

You can run the tests in the terminal with `npm test`

If your table creation and inserting has worked as expected this test should pass once you complete the function.

### Task 6

In order to insert the rides to our database we have a couple of problems;
The rides data has keys of `park_name` but the columns in our table need to have `park_id` inserted into them.

In order to be able to insert the rides data we will need to be able to work out which `park_id` goes with which `park_name`, in order to do this we will have to make some changes to the way we have implemented inserting the data in the seed file. We will need access to the rows that have been inserted to the `parks` table.

In order to access all of this data you will need to make sure the `insert` function is `returning` the data from the rows.

Refactor the `insertParks` function to return all of the data that has been inserted

### Task 7

You should now be able to access the data in the `.then` block after you've inserted the parks, you will need to format the rides data so that each of the rides instead of having a `park_name` property has an appropriate `park_id`.

create a function called `formatRides`, this function should take an array of rides and update the appropriate keys on each one, this is a utility function, write some tests for this function in `utils.test.js` and make sure to use TDD. Think about how you are going to ensure that each ride has the correct `park_id`.

```js
[
  {
    ride_name: 'Tidal Wave',
    year_opened: 2000,
    park_name: 'Thorpe Park',
    votes: 1,
  },
];
```

will become

```js
[
  {
    ride_name: 'Tidal Wave',
    year_opened: 2000,
    park_id: 1,
    votes: 1,
  },
];
```

### Task 8

Now that we are able to format the rides, use that function to format the rides data and insert the data into the rides table.

### Task 9

Now we should have some rides data stored in our database, You can complete the `selectRidesByParkId` function in models.js

** Hint: I know that we've just gone through all the effort of converting the `park_name`s to `park_id`s but our clients will want the names to be sent to them. **

### Task 10

Complete the `updatePark` function in models.js

### Task 11

Complete the `removePark` function in models.js

## Advanced Tasks

###Â Task 12

Take a look at the foods and stalls data in the `data` folder, this is a many to many relationship, think about the data types you want to store and which tables you will need to create to build this

** Hint: You will need to create three tables if you want to store this without duplicating any information **

Update your seed function to create the tables required to store the stalls and food data

### Task 13

Insert the data from foods and stalls into your database.

Do make sure to write some tests for any utility functions that you need to create.

### Task 14

Create and test a `getStallById` model, this function should return all the foods that stall stocks as well as all the stall information

### Task 15

Create and test an `updateStall` model that will add an extra food that stall serves.

### Task 16

Create and test a `removeStall` model.

## Even More Challenges!

Still going? ðŸ˜® Have a go at building any of the following models:

- `createStall()`
- `selectRides()`
- update your `selectRides` function so it takes an optional minVotes parameter, if its present it should only select the rides with votes above the given number
- update your `selectRides` function so it takes an optional openSince parameter, if its present it should only select the rides that opened after a given date
